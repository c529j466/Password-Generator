## Description


For this project, I was tasked with creating a password generator that would follow specfic parameters based on the users choices. The page functioned in that the user would click a button to generate a password, a prompt would appear asking for the amount of characters they would like the password to be, a series of questions would ask what types of characters they want the password to have, and then the password would appear on the screen. My motivation to complete this project was to better understand how Javascript can be used to add functionality to html documents. The project is also useful because password generates add randomness to a password, making it harder to guess from nefarious sources.

## Installation

To install the password generator, I used the given html and css documents to create a javascript document that would add the needed functionality to the page. I then created a github repository, cloned that repository to my local device, copied the code files to the repository, pushed the files to the repository on github, and then enabled pages on github to create a live link. 

## Usage
